# Zhiva Windows

This module provides the Windows-specific components and installation scripts for the Zhiva application framework.

## Role in the Zhiva Project

`windows` contains the necessary scripts and executables to install and run Zhiva applications on Windows operating systems. It provides PowerShell scripts for bootstrapping the environment and installing the native components required for Zhiva applications to run properly on Windows.

## Primary Responsibilities

-   **Environment Setup**: Offers PowerShell scripts (`bootstrap.ps1`) to prepare the Windows environment for Zhiva applications.
-   **Installation Process**: Provides installation scripts (`install.ps1`) to download and set up the native Zhiva components.
-   **Dependency Management**: Handles the installation of required dependencies like Git on Windows systems.
-   **Bootstrap Execution**: Manages the initial setup process by downloading and running the necessary bootstrap executable.

## Technology

-   **PowerShell**: The installation and setup scripts are written in PowerShell for Windows compatibility.
-   **Windows Executables**: Includes Windows-native executables for core functionality.

## Vision

The goal for the `windows` module is to provide a seamless installation and setup experience for Zhiva applications on Windows platforms. Future development will focus on improving the reliability of the installation process and ensuring compatibility with various Windows versions while maintaining an automated and user-friendly setup experience.
